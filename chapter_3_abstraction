Object creation :

Object creation when we create object of any class ,Memory get intialized to class and it get memory /space in Ram.it will help in execution of program sucessfully.

ClockDisplay()
{
getTime();
}

 public void getTime() // method
{

starting time = 
endtime=
System.out.print(" startingtime and endtime" + startingtime + "  " + endtime);

}


// Constructor /Method Overloading

A class may contain more than one constructor, or more than one method of the same name, as long as each has a distinctive set of parameter types.

This is overloading of method ,as you see in example method name vishnupriya and parameter are different

private void Vishupriya(string lastname)
{

}

private void Vishnupriya(string Familyname){

{

}

// calling
1st method    , internal method name
Vishupriya(M)

//
2nd method
Vishupriya(A)





// externl method calling
objectname.Vishupriya(M)

objectname.Vishupriya(A)
