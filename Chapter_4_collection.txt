Arraylist<String> priya having 2 index 0 t0 2 , 0 , 1, 2

length of Arraylist = 3 ,length of arraylist = number of index  ,number of element
As index starting from 0 ,what will be last index = length -1  , 2

Q - If a collection stores 10 objects, what value would be returned from a call to
its size method?

Answer : 10 object in saved in Arraylist = 
size  = number of element saved in arraylist , 10
index  start 0 -9 ,last index will be 9

# Remove element from arraylist

priya.remove(index_number)
priya.remove(0) # remove first element from array list
priya.remove(9) # remove last element from arraylist
.size ,.length ,number of element in arraylist



##
import java.util.ArrayList;

java - > util -> Arraylist.java file this called collection of classes or single package that is used in program to validate the 
predefined function that we used in program
Size ,remove,length of arraylist


# object hold value and its variable

#Arijit is having list of song out of that you want to listen " khariyat pucho ,chichhore movie song star sushan singh" 2021
String filename = files.get(index);
player.startPlaying(filename)



System.out.println(files.get(0));

files is arraylist variable which will call get method to print value present at index 0;


for loop 
A loop can be used to execute a block of statements repeatedly without having to write them multiple times.

System.out.println(" vishnupriya );
System.out.println(" vishnupriya );
System.out.println(" vishnupriya );
System.out.println(" vishnupriya );
System.out.println(" vishnupriya );
System.out.println(" vishnupriya );
System.out.println(" vishnupriya ); 
##It is feasible to print it 1000 times writing this instruction to print your name or you will look for alternative method

This is the case where you need for loop to print 1000

Example:
Syntax
for(ElementType element : collection) 
{
loop body
}

________________________________________
for each element in collection do: 
{
loop body
}
_____________________________________________
Example
for(String filename : files) # unless the last index of file , files is having 10 files  , 1 to 10 , file is collection Arraylist,holding files which is string type ,almost 10 file suppose
{
System.out.println(filename); # file 1 to file 10
}
