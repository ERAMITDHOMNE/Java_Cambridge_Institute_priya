## What is fixture

A test fixture is a fixed state of a set of objects used as a baseline for running tests. The purpose of a test fixture is 
to ensure that there is a well known and the fixed environment in which tests are run so that results are repeatable. 

Examples of fixtures:

Preparation of input data and setup/creation of fake or mock objects( # creating multiple objecct and assign value)
Copying a specific known set of files creating a test fixture will create a set of objects initialized to certain states.
JUnit provides annotations so that test classes can have fixture run before or after every test, or one time fixtures that 
run before and after only once for all test methods in a class.

There are four fixture annotations: two for class-level fixtures and two for method-level ones. At the class level, 
you have @BeforeClass and @AfterClass, and at the method (or test) level, you have @Before and @After.
