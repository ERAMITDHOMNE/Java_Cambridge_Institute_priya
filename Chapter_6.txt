Chapter 6 :

Coupling : - it tells degree of interdependency of modules in code , different method /modules ,registration ,login,payment modules,filling 
personal details,uploading document
Working of one module should not affect other module


Cohesion : it tells the degree of connnectivity between every modules,it says how stronly one modules connnected to other modules
It is focus on describing functional strength of every module(Method,class) ,whether that modules is capable to perform hole task
efficiently

cohesion should be more ,coupling should be less(loose coupling)

# Question (Important question)
What is this Keyword in Java?
this keyword in Java is a reference variable that refers to the current object of a method or a constructor. The main purpose of using this keyword in Java is to remove the confusion between class attributes and parameters that have same names.

Following are various uses of 'this' keyword in Java:

It can be used to refer instance variable of current class
It can be used to invoke or initiate current class constructor
It can be passed as an argument in the method call
It can be passed as argument in the constructor call
It can be used to return the current class instance


Syntax
this.variablename = argument_variable


##
Encapsulation is an one of the oops concept that is used to bind/combine variable,value,method,object together inside the class,all combine to act as single unit.
It means it tells that better the binding between different unit ,good is the design of code


The encapsulation guideline (hiding implementation information from view) suggests that only
information about what a class can do should be visible to the outside, not about how it does it.
This has a great advantage: if no other class knows how our information is stored, then we can
easily change how it is stored without breaking other classes
